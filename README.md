##Consumer Complaint Resolution Analysis Using Python
#Project Overview
This project aims to analyze consumer complaint data to predict whether a customer is disputed or not. By leveraging various Python libraries and machine learning algorithms, we can classify customer complaints and help businesses improve their customer service and product offerings.
#Objective
The primary objective is to use machine learning models to predict customer disputes based on historical complaint data. This involves data preprocessing, visualization, model building, and evaluation.
Tools and Libraries Used

    Python: Programming language
    Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
    Seaborn & Matplotlib: Data visualization
    Sklearn: Machine learning library for model building and evaluation
    Jupyter Notebook: Development environment

Dataset Description

The dataset contains customer complaints with the following key features:

    Date received: The day the complaint was received
    Product: Product category (e.g., credit cards, loans)
    Sub-product: Specific product type (e.g., mortgage, insurance)
    Issue: Description of the complaint
    Company public response: Company's response to the complaint
    Company: Name of the company
    State: State where the customer resides
    ZIP code: Customer's postal code
    Submitted via: Method used to submit the complaint (e.g., web, phone)
    Date sent to company: Date when the complaint was forwarded to the company
    Timely response?: Whether the company responded timely (Yes/No)
    Consumer disputed?: Target variable indicating if the consumer disputed the response (Yes/No)
    Complaint ID: Unique identifier for each complaint
